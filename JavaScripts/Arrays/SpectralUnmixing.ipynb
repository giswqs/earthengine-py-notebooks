        "Install the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install) and [geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap). The **geemap** Python package is built upon the [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as `Map.addLayer()`, `Map.setCenter()`, and `Map.centerObject()`.\n",
        "The following script checks if the geemap package has been installed. If not, it will install geemap, which automatically installs its [dependencies](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap#dependencies), including earthengine-api, folium, and ipyleaflet.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only ([source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a)). Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) currently does not support ipyleaflet ([source](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/60#issuecomment-596225619)). Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use [`import geemap.eefolium`](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/geemap/eefolium.py). If you are using geemap with [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use [`import geemap`](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap/blob/master/geemap/geemap.py), which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."
